# Super Jos√© DreamWorld

Check out the game's [itch.io page](https://rogersama.itch.io/super-jose-dreamworld).

## Description

It was supposed to be just a normal ciesta...
In this demo, you play as a guy who falls asleep in his couch only to find himself trapped in his own dream world. To wake up, he'll have to face his grown up fears in the form of pixelated enemies.

This game was made to the [Game Boy Competition 2025](https://itch.io/jam/gbcompo25) jam.

This is my first game ever. Be kind <3

I hope you enjoy it!
